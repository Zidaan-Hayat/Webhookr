# Webhooker

A simple (and terribly written) discord webhook sender written in `python`.

# Setup

This assumes you have at least [python3](https://python.org) installed.

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zzz9194/Webhooker.git

# Go into the repository
cd Webhooker

# Install the requirements
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the file
python3 __main__.py
```

# Usage 

Once you run the file, you get a simple up and down selection tool which can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/simple-term-menu/) [or here](https://github.com/IngoMeyer441/simple-term-menu) and is a very useful tool. 

If at any time you want to cancel a process, there should be a `Cancel` or `Stop` option. Otherwise you can enter `CTRL+C`

# Disclaimer

None of the imports were made by me and a lot of the resources were created by other people. See them all here:
